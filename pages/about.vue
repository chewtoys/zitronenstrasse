        | The Project

      p
        | Berlin is a wonderful city. So vivid, multicultural, full of history and with so many secret places.

      p
        | However,
        | &nbsp;
        span.text-accent
          | sometimes finding the right place for the right mood is so hard
        | , even harder when you are looking for a romantic place. It has to be nice, but not so much cozy; it has to have nice music, but not too much loud; nice drinks and menu, but nothing too much classic; with nice people, but not too much crowd.

      p
        | So here you can find a small selection of romantic spots: some of them are perfect for a brunch or a coffee, ones for the evening with drinks and music, others are bars or outdoors places where drinking a beer and waiting for the sunset.
      
      P
        | Hopefully you will find here your romantic place.

        | The Name

      p
        span.text-accent
          | Why Zitronenstrasse?
        | &nbsp;
        | It is just a name of a street? A real one? What does it means?
      
      p
        | Well, here the story ...

      p
        | Basically Zitronenstrasse is an
        | &nbsp;
        span.text-accent
          | inside joke between two languages
        |, German and Italian.

      p
        | In Italian there is slang word that means
        | &nbsp;
        span.text-accent
          | making out
        | :
        | &nbsp;
        i
          | 'limonare'
        | , from the word
        | &nbsp;
        i
          | 'limone'
        | &nbsp;
        | (lemon).

      p
        | So we mixed this word with the German name for
        | &nbsp;
        span.text-accent
          | street
        | &nbsp;
        | (
        i
          | Strasse
        | &nbsp;
        | or 
        | &nbsp;
        i
          | Stra√üe
        | ). And so, we got Zitronenstrasse: the romantic place for making out ...
